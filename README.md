# Threaded Bitonic Sort Network

> A project by Darren Karl Sapalo, Michael Lance, and David John Ricafort, Master of Science in Computer Science students in De La Salle University Manila (PH).

## What is Bitonic Sort?

The Bitonic sort is a parallel algorithm for sorting, which makes it suitable for learning how to do parallel processing or asynchronous work. This is a great exercise for students learning about concurrency, race conditions, blocking, and the like.

You can read more about the Bitonic sort in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter).

## Why did you do this project?

This was a simple homework that Solomon See, our professor in Advanced Operating Systems (ADVANOS), gave when the course started. 

## How can I contribute?

There will be more students of MS-CS in DLSU Manila, so I hope that homeworks and projects like these can be properly collected and documented.

> ### We have this great opportunity to discover, learn, persist, and share knowledge with our fellow students. I dream of a collaborative CCS Graduate studies community (alumni and students) that are able to share resources to making learning much more easy and accessible.

You can reach out to me via Github or Twitter (@darrensapalo) to share my dream or to just talk.
